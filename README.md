# Ascalert
Simple alert notification for your web apps.

Just include the css and js files on the `dist` folder to your HTML page.
```
<link rel=‘stylesheet’ href=‘yourassetpath/ascalert.css’>
```
```
<script type='text/javascript' src='yourassetpath/ascalert.js'></script>
```

Easy! Now you can call the alert object via :
```
ascalert("Some text you want to display")
```

You also can throw an timed alert, just add interval number as the second parameter
```
ascalert("Timed alert text shows down here", 3000)
```

Enjoy!
